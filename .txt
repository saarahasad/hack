Artificial Intelligence (AI) and blockchain are two disruptive
technologies proving to be a powerful combination, improving
virtually every industry. Research in Artificial Intelligence
has come a long way, with many corporations, organizations and
individuals greatly benefiting from Machine Learning services.
However, corporations, organizations and individuals with
problems AI can solve are hesitant to solicit services from
third-party agents by sharing their private data to obtain those
valuable predictions. Further, research on improving Machine
Learning models suggests utilizing larger datasets to obtain
better working models. However, handling the labelling of a
sufficient amount of data with limited in-house resources is a
time-consuming and costly operation. Consequently, businesses
prefer crowdsourcing options when labelling data to train
Machine Learning models. Also, protecting the business's data is
as imperative as protecting the customer's data. It is not in
favour of businesses to share their Machine Learning models with
those they offer services to, as these models may be
proprietary. This proposal focuses on creating a community of
machine learning practitioners who can contribute to AI
businesses by building models and datasets in a blockchain
environment in exchange for a reward. It also permits agents and
organizations with problems that could be solved with AI to
solicit solutions without sharing their data.

This research utilizes the benefits of multi-party
computation (MPC) to build Machine Learning models that provide
predictions on encrypted data. In many cases, it is not in favour
of businesses to share their Machine Learning models with those
they offer services to, as these models may be proprietary. Using
MPC, organizations that solicit services are not required to send
their data to AI businesses; encrypted models are sent to the
machines with the data. Therefore, this research focuses on
providing encrypted models to offer predictions on encrypted data.
</p>
<p>
Blockchain offers many benefits, such as decentralization, persistence, transparency, and trust, which could complement Artificial Intelligence to create a secure and reliable framework. The main objectives include:
<ul>
<li>Develop a blockchain based based protocol for crowdsourcing data and models from contributors with a promising reward scheme.</li>
<li>Build a platform for businesses to provide Machine Learning services while maintaining the privacy of their models and client data.</li>
<li>Build Machine Learning Models using multi-party computation (MPC), to develop encrypted models that offer predictions on encrypted data. </li>
