                  Artificial Intelligence (AI) and blockchain are two disruptive technologies proving to be a powerful combination, improving
                  virtually every industry. Research in Artificial Intelligence has come a long way, with many corporations, organizations and
                  individuals greatly benefiting from Machine Learning services. However, corporations, organizations and individuals with
                  problems AI can solve are hesitant to solicit services from third-party agents by sharing their private data to obtain those
                  valuable predictions. Further, research on improving Machine Learning models suggests utilizing larger datasets to obtain
                  better working models. However, handling the labelling of a sufficient amount of data with limited in-house resources is a
                  time-consuming and costly operation. Consequently, businesses prefer crowdsourcing options when labelling data to train
                  Machine Learning models. Also, protecting the business's data is as imperative as protecting the customer's data. It is not
                  in favour of businesses to share their Machine Learning models with those they offer services to, as these models may be
                  proprietary. This proposal focuses on creating a community of machine learning practitioners who can contribute to AI
                  businesses by building models and datasets in a blockchain environment in exchange for a reward. It also permits agents
                  and organizations with problems that could be solved with AI to solicit solutions without sharing their data.

                    This research focuses on creating a community of machine learning
                    practitioners who can contribute to AI businesses by building
                    models and datasets in a blockchain environment in exchange for a

                    It also permits organizations and agents with problems
                      that could be solved with AI to solicit solutions without sharing

                      This research utilizes the benefits of multi-party
                      computation (MPC) to build Machine Learning models that provide
                      predictions on encrypted data. In many cases, it is not in favour
                      of businesses to share their Machine Learning models with those
                      they offer services to, as these models may be proprietary. Using
                      MPC, organizations that solicit services are not required to send
                      their data to AI businesses; encrypted models are sent to the
                      machines with the data. Therefore, this research focuses on
                      providing encrypted models to offer predictions on encrypted data.

                      Blockchain offers many benefits, such as decentralization, persistence, transparency, and trust, which could complement Artificial Intelligence to create a secure and reliable framework. The main objectives include:
